Paris and Helen, Orpheus and Eurydice, Abelard and Eloise, Troilus and Cressida, Tristan and eult, Shiva and Sari, Layla and Majnun: thousands of romantic poems, songs, and stories come across the centuries from Europe, the Middle East, Japan, China, India, and every other society that has left written or oral records.

Neverless, neuroscientists believe that the basic human emotions and motivations arise from distinct systems of neural activity, networks that derive from mammalian precursors. This article takes the neurological approach. It does not attempt to define one's idiosyncratic ways of loving that develop in childhood, nor why an individual chooses one person rather than another.

Psychological studies indicate that romantic love is associated with a discrete constellation of emotions, motivations, and behaviors. Romantic love begins as an individual comes to regard another as special, even unique. The lover then intensely focuses his or her emotion on this preferred individual, aggrandizing the beloved's better traits and overlooking or minimizing his or her flaws. Lovers experience extreme energy, hyperactiviry, sleeplessness, impulsivity, euphoria, and mood swings. They are goal-oriented and strongly motivated to win the beloved.
