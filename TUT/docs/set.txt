create an empty set ==>
st = set()
print st
d = {} #creates an empty dictionary
print d



remove duplicates from a sequence (list) ==>
basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana']
fruit = set(basket) # create a set without duplicates
print fruit



test membership in sequence faster ==>
fruit = set(['orange', 'pear', 'apple', 'banana'])
list = ['orange', 'pear', 'apple', 'banana']
print 'orange' in fruit  # fast membership testing
print 'crabgrass' in fruit
print 'orange' in list
print 'crabgrass' in list



test union, intersection  and difference in two lists ==>
a = set('abracadabra')
b = set('alacazam')
c = set([1,2,3,4,5,6])
d = set([5,2,4,7,8,3,9])
print a
print a - b      # letters in a but not in b
print a | b      # letters in either a or b
print a & b      # letters in both a and b
print a ^ b      # letters in a or b but not both
print c
print c - d      # numbers in c but not in d
print c | d      # numbers in either c or d
print c & d      # numbers in both c and d
print c ^ d      # numbers in c or d but not both



use set comprehension to test for set differences ==>
a = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'}
print a
